# How to MicroPython
This repo is my journey learning MicroPython,  documented as a presentation

presentation can be seen here: https://fragmuffin.github.io/howto-micropython/

the content found here is very likely not unique, but making it is part of my journey...
selfish, I know, but I hope you get something out of it.


# Target Content

What I still need to add to the presentation

* ADC Input
* How to run your program
    * /flash/main.py
    * /sd/main.py
* LCD fun
* Using 3rd party modules
    * compiling to pyc?
