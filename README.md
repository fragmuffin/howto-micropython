# How to MicroPython
This repo is my journey learning MicroPython,  documented as a presentation

presentation can be seen here: https://fragmuffin.github.io/howto-micropython/

the content found here is very likely not unique, but making it is part of my journey...
selfish, I know, but I hope you get something out of it.
