# Examples

These examples exhibit some or all functionality shown in the slides.


## Examples are for pyboard

These examples have only been tested on `pyboard` v1.1.

Furthermore: any examples that `import pyb` probably won't work on anything else.


## Running an example

Copy the entire contents of an example folder onto a blank micro SD card.

Put the micro SD card into the `pyboard`, and hit the reset button.

If you want to see `print` outputs, connect to a `REPL` and press `[Ctrl+D]`
to perform a soft reset.
You should be able to see `print` outputs right from the beginning of execution.
